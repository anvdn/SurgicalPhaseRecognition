# e6691-2022Spring-assign2

The description of the assignment for e6691 2022 spring is provided in a google doc

This repo is an (empty) template which is distributed to students as a part of the Github classroom assignment process.

The repository (assigned by the Github Classroom) will become (after students accept the github classroom link invite) the student version for this assignments.
To complete the assignment/homework, students need to upload their code and other material into this repository.

## How to modify this README.md file
Students need to maintain this repo to have a "professional look":
* Remove the instructions (this text)
* Provide description of the topic/assignment
* Provide organization of this repo 
* Add all relevant links: name of google docs and link to them, links to public repos used, 
* For assignments, the additional info may be minimal, but for paper reviews it should include the organization of the directory, brief description how to run the code, what is in the code, links to relevant papers, links to relevant githubs, etc...

## INSTRUCTIONS for (re) naming the student's solution repository for assignments with one student:
* Students need to use the following naming rules for the repository with their solutions: e6691-2022Spring-assign2-UNI 
(the first part "e6691-2022Spring-assign2" will probably be inherited from the assignment, so only UNI needs to be added) 
* Initially, the system may give the repo a name which ends with a student's Github userid. 
The student must change that name and replace it with the name requested in the point above (containing their UNI)
* Good Example: e6691-2022Spring-assign1-zz9999;   Bad example: e6691-2022Spring-assign1-ee6040-2022Spring-assign1-zz9999.
* This change can be done from the "Settings" tab which is located on the repo page.

## INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. 
Students need to use a 4-letter groupID): 
* Example 1 - Template: e6691-2022Spring-assign2-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e6691-2022Spring-assign2-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.
* Example 2 - Template: e6691-2022Spring-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e6691-2022Spring-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.
